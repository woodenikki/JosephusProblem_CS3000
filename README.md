# Josephus Problem
## Final Project for CS 3000: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
This program will simulate the Josephus Problem, a theoretical counting game where in a circle of n soldiers with a pre-determined starting spot, soldiers will kill the person to their left continuously until only one remains. The goal of this simulation is to choose the chair in which you will survive.
